# Heisenberg model in two dimensions using Monte Carlo method of Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm

For the Monte Carlo step, generate trial configurations by the Barker-Watts spin rotation [Chem. Phys. Lett. 3 , 144
(1969)] of randomly selected spins with a magnitude of the maximum spin rotation adjusted to ensure half of the trial
configurations are rejected in the equilibrium state.

i and j are lattice indexes in 2D, <ij> stands for nearest neighbors.

The parameters of the model are J-exchange interaction, A - anisotropy, and D - dipolar coupling. The boundary conditions shall be periodic.
